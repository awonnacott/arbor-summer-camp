        <p class="mb-4">
          Arbor Summer Camp (Mon June 2 - Fri June 6) is a pedagogy playground — a place to teach and take experimental bootcamps, workshops, seminars, and multi-day immersive experiences in the most target-rich environment a teacher could dream of. It takes place the week between <a href="https://less.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-campfire-600 hover:text-campfire-500">LessOnline</a> and <a href="https://manifest.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-campfire-600 hover:text-campfire-500">Manifest</a>, when hundreds of curious learners will flock to Lighthaven to discuss, debate, and bet on every topic under the sun.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          These branches will run in parallel across campus, spanning 2-5 days. We'll have 10-15 different experimental "branches" (workshops, bootcamps, what have you) running in parallel. My team at Arbor is also running a pedagogy incubator the week before (May 26-29), to help prepare new-ish branch leaders with promising ideas but not much teaching experience.

            The branches are each multi-day workshops, on any of a range of topics. Our intention is for the week to be a pedagogy playground, where ASC attendees can be guinea pigs for anything you want to figure out.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a bootcamp/workshop/etc idea in your pocket, we'd love to hear about it and figure out whether it makes sense for you to run it as an <strong>independent branch</strong> (with minimal support from us, for existing established workshops) or as an <strong>incubated branch</strong>, which requires attending our pedagogy incubator May 26-29.
