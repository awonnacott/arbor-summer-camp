Learn high-level GPU architecture and how to make it do things for you quickly and efficiently!  In particular, I'll be teaching how to write fast implementations for every part of a transformer, various methods used in AI system design and how to adapt existing implementations of performant functions for your specific use-case (e.g. GQA, chunked attention or some weird activation you need)
