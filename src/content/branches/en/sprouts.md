This is a real-world business-building activity for kids (ages: 5-12). They will start a business, operate it at Lighthaven, and earn real profits, all within a single day.

1) "Incorporate" our photobooth business and capitalize it by buying "stock" in the company. Each kid will purchase one "share."
2) Develop our business plan, pricing, and marketing.
3) Build marketing collateral and distribute it to adult attendees
4) Operate the business, collect money, ensure customer satisfaction
5) Account for revenues and costs (photo paper, ink, marketing materials, equipment "rental")
6) Distribute profits to shareholders
7) Liquidate and close the business

If you're not bringing kids to the event but are reading this... please support the kids' business when you see us!
