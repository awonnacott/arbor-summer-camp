Stock exchanges routinely process tens of thousands of messages per second, and are designed to process millions in case of high volatility. This isn’t particularly surprising in itself -- Google handles approximately this many queries. What’s surprising is that stock exchanges can do this on a single server, whereas Google’s search engine runs on untold fleets of machines around the world.

General topics:

- Building very high throughput systems in resource constrained environments
- Designing reliable architectures for low latency software systems
- How a stock exchange produces trades between traders' and investors' orders (order books, auctions, implied matching)
- Fairness implications: equal treatment of incoming orders, dissemination of market information to market participants and the public

Activities:

- Teams draft design proposals for handling specific challenges
- Individuals to optimize market components in toy market environments

Prerequisites:

- No trading or finance experience needed.
- Basic coding experience is required.
- Bring your own laptop.
